## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers.  
Severity of response will be determined by the maintainers and may include:

- A private warning to the offender.  
- Temporary or permanent removal of contributor privileges (commenting, pushing, PR reviews).  
- Banning from project channels and organizations.  
- Other actions deemed appropriate by project maintainers.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible.  
You can report incidents by:

1. Opening an issue titled **"Code of Conduct Incident"** in this repository and marking it as private (maintainers will handle it confidentially).  
2. Or emailing the project conduct contact at **conduct@open-source-you.org**.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the incident with dates, locations (issue/PR/chat), and people involved.
- Screenshots or copies of relevant messages if available.
- Any steps you would like the maintainers to take.

All reports will be handled with discretion to protect reporter privacy wherever possible.

---

## Moderation & Appeals

- Moderators / maintainers will follow a fair process: gather information, make a decision, and communicate actions to involved parties.  
- If you disagree with an outcome, you may request an appeal by emailing the conduct contact (see Reporting). Appeals will be reviewed by a different maintainer than the one who handled the original report.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant** and other open-source community standards to fit the needs of the **Hackotberfest2025** project.  
By participating, you agree to abide by these guidelines.
